Adds the revision and path of your Subversion working copy to the admin footer.

== Description ==

This plugin allows WordPress testers and administrators to display the revision
and path of the Subversion working copy that their WordPress installs are
running on.  The information goes into a line in the admin footer.  This line
can be removed in favor of a tooltip if that is preferred (see installation
instructions).

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin file to your WordPress install and activate!

If you don't want the line with the working copy path, you can opt for just
the tooltip that appears when you mouse over the version number.  To do this
visit http://your.example-blog.com/wp-admin/options.php and change 
the "show-svn-tooltip-only" option to "1".
